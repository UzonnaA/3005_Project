# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Membership Tracker

This is a Java-based backend system for managing a gym’s core operations, including members, billing, training sessions, and class registrations. It was designed to follow relational database principles and shows how to structure a real-world app using clean, organized logic.

🗂️ The app connects to a PostgreSQL database and supports basic queries like:
- Viewing gym members and their goals
- Managing billing and health metrics
- Handling training sessions with time conflict prevention
- Registering members for group classes

👨‍💻 I built this project as part of a university assignment, with the goal of exploring Java + SQL integration in a clean and testable way. While it’s simple, it highlights core backend concepts and relational thinking that can be applied to real applications.
