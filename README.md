# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Membership Tracker

This is a Java-based backend system for managing a gym’s core operations, including members, billing, training sessions, and class registrations. It was designed to follow relational database principles and shows how to structure a real-world app using organized logic.

The app connects to a PostgreSQL database and supports basic queries like:
- Viewing gym members and their goals
- Managing billing and health metrics
- Handling training sessions with time conflict prevention
- Registering members for group classes

I built this project as part of a university assignment, with the goal of exploring Java + SQL integration. While it’s simple, it highlights core backend concepts and relational thinking that can be applied to real applications.

(While the demo was made for marking purposes, it still offers a good look at how the app functions behind the scenes.)
